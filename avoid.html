                <li>How can I prevent contracting Ebola?</li>
                <p>The <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ebola-virus/basics/prevention/con-20031241" target="_blank">Mayo Clinic's</a> provides a few tips on how to avoid contracting Ebola:
                <ul id="mayolist">
                    <li>Avoid areas of known outbreak</li>
                    <li>Wash your hands frequently</li>
                    <li>Avoid contact with infected people</li>
                    <li>Avoid contact with the remains of those infected</li>
                </ul></p>
                <li>What are the risks of contracting ebola from travel?</li>
                <p>Ebola is not an airborne illness, so travel is relatively safe. You may be subjected to a health screening in an airport if you are returning from a country where Ebola is still a major problem, during which you will be checked for symptoms of Ebola. If you were on the same flight as someone found to be infected with Ebola, you will be notified, and the CDC will take proper precautions. It is important not to come into contact with others' bodily fluids. </p>
                <li>Should I still be worried?</li>
                <p>Unless you expect to be in direct contact with someone infected by Ebola, the probability of being infected is miniscule.</p>
            </ul>
