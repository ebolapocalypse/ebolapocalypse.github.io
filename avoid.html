                <li>How can I prevent contracting ebola?</li>
                <p>From the <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ebola-virus/basics/prevention/con-20031241" target="_blank">Mayo Clinic's webiste</a>, here are a few tips on how to avoid contracting ebola:
                <ul id="mayolist">
                    <li>Avoid areas of known outbreak.</li>
                    <li>Wash your hands frequently.</li>
                    <li>Avoid contact with infected people.</li>
                    <li>Don't handle remains.</li>
                </ul></p>
                <li>What are the risks of contracting ebola from travel?</li>
                <p>You may be subjected to a health screening in an airport if you are returning from a country where ebola is still a major problem, during which you will be checked for symptoms of ebola, like fever. If you were on the same flight as someone found to be infected with ebola, you will be notified, and the CDC will take proper precautions. Again, in all situations, it's important not to come into contact with others' bodily fluids. Ebola is not an airborne illness, so travel is relatively safe, even if you are on the same flight or train ride as someone with ebola.</p>
                <li>Should I avoid all human contact forever?</li>
                <p>No. That's irrational and unproductive. As long as you're educated about the topic and take proper precautions, you can continue to function as a normal member of society. (For now, at least.)</p>
