                <li>What is ebola?</li>
                <p><strong>Ebola virus disease (EVD)</strong> is an illness transmitted from wild animals to humans and spread through the human population by human-to-human transmission. It is often fatal in humans (average fatality rate is 50%), and its symptoms develop from fever fatigue, headache, muscle pain, and sore throat, to vomiting, diarrhea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and, sometimes, internal and external bleeding. There is currently a severe outbreak of ebola in certain parts of west Africa, and it has, in isolated cases, spread to countries outside of the African continent such as the United States.</p>
                <li>Should I be worried?</li>
                <p>At this point, probably not. Unless you have come into contact with the bodily fluids of a person infected with ebola (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/united-states-imported-case.html" target="_blank">list of cases in the US here</a>), you do not have ebola. Ebola cannot survive long outside of a host, living or dead, so only human-to-human transmission from someone already displaying symptoms can cause you to get ebola.</p>
                <li>How can I avoid ebola?</li>
                <p>Basically, if someone has ebola, don't come into contact with their bodily fluids. That's it.</p>
