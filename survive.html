          <p> According to WHO, "first symptoms are the sudden onset of fever fatigue, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding (e.g. oozing from the gums, blood in the stools)"." </p>
          <p> Have you traveled recently to countries where you may have been exposed to Ebola?</p>

          <h2> What to do if you think you have Ebola?</h2>
          <p> Stay calm. Symptoms are very similar to a variety of diseases, and the odds of contracting Ebola in the United States are extremely slim. Don't panic.Contact your doctor/ local physician first and explain your symptoms and recent travel. Only if you're certain that you've actually been exposed to Ebola, should you go and contact your local health department and the CDC to give yourself the best chance of surviving the virus.

        <div class ="col-lg-4">
          <h2> How do we treat Ebola? </h2>
          <p> At this time there is currently no vaccine or treatment for the Ebola virus. However, early treatment of the symptoms through IV's and oxygen/ maintaining blood pressure can increase the odds of surviving. </p>
