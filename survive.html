          <li>Do you have Ebola?</li>
          <p> According to WHO, "first symptoms are the sudden onset of fever fatigue, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding (e.g. oozing from the gums, blood in the stools)"." </p>
          <p> The symptoms of the Ebola virus are very similar to those of influenza.  You most likely do not have Ebola unless you have been travelling in West Africa or come in direct contact with someone infected by Ebola.</p>
                
          <li> What to do if you think you have Ebola.</li>
          <p> Symptoms of Ebola are very similar to those of a variety of diseases, and the odds of contracting Ebola in the United States are extremely low. If you are feeling unwell, consult a medical professional. 
      
          <li> How do we treat Ebola? </li>
          <p> There is currently no FDA-approved vaccine or treatment for the Ebola. However, early intervention can increase the odds of surviving.  If you are feeling unwell, consult a medical professional. </p>
